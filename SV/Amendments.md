#Blynk Amendments
###Tell every maker about Blynk
No pressure. Just do it. Now.
###Make your idea work without Blynk
Blynk can be easily integrated in almost any project. But before that - make it work **without** it. After you are sure that you can get all the sensor data or can control things from the code – integrate Blynk and make it even more awesome.
###Use search
We are always happy to chat and help, but remember - every time you ask the question that was answered many many times before that, Blynk Team is not building a new widget or new cool feature. So:
- google before asking
- use search on our forum, it works really well
- check Instructables
###Always wrap your code
Though shalt not post code without ```wrapping it```
